# Whole History Rating

A system for ranking game players by skill, based on RÃ©mi Coulom's [Whole History Rating](http://remi.coulom.free.fr/WHR/WHR.pdf) algorithm, with modifications to support handicaps.

Developed for use on [GoShrine](http://goshrine.com), but the code is not go specific.  It can support any two player game, as long as the outcome is a simple win/loss. 

Installation
------------

* gem install whole_history_rating

Enjoy!
