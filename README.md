# Whole History Rating

A system for ranking game players by skill, based on RÃ©mi Coulom's Whole History Rating algorithm.

Developed for use on [GoShrine](http://goshrine.com), but the code is not go specific.  It can support any two player game, as long as the outcome is a simple win/loss.  An addition to the algorithm is support for handicaps. 

Installation
------------

* gem install whole-history-rating

Enjoy!
