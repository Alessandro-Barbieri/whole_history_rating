# Whole History Rating

A system for ranking game players by skill, based on RÃ©mi Coulom's [Whole History Rating](http://remi.coulom.free.fr/WHR/WHR.pdf) algorithm, with modifications to support handicaps.

Developed for use on [GoShrine](http://goshrine.com), but the code is not go specific.  It can support any two player game, as long as the outcome is a simple win/loss. 

Installation
------------

* gem install whole_history_rating


Usage
-----

    require 'whole_history_rating'
    
    @whr = WholeHistoryRating::Base.new
    
    # WholeHistoryRating::Base#create_game arguments: black player name, white player name, winner, day number, handicap
    @whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "B", 1, 0)
    @whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "W", 2, 0)
    @whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "W", 3, 0)

    # Iterate the WHR algorithm towards convergence with more players/games, more iterations are needed.
    @whr.iterate(50)
    
    # Results are stored in one triplet for each day: [day_number, elo_rating, uncertainty]
    @whr.ratings_for_player("shusaku") => [[1, -92, 71], [2, -94, 71], [3, -95, 71], [4, -96, 72]]
    @whr.ratings_for_player("shusai") => [[1, 92, 71], [2, 94, 71], [3, 95, 71], [4, 96, 72]]

Enjoy!
